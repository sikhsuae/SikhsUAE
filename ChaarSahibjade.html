    <h1>Char Sahibzade - The Martyrdom of Guru Gobind Singh's Sons</h1>

    <p><span class="highlight">Sahibzada</span> means "son" in Punjabi, and it is a traditional term, not commonly used in everyday language today. It is most reverently associated with the four sons of Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth Sikh Guru. The plural form of Sahibzada is <span class="highlight">Sahibzade</span>, with a stretched "A" sound at the end.</p>

    <p>The <span class="highlight">younger pair</span>, known as the <span class="highlight">Chotta Sahibzade</span>, were martyred together at Sirhind by the Mughal forces at the tender ages of 6 and 9 years old. On the other hand, the <span class="highlight">older Sahibzade</span>, known as the <span class="highlight">Vaada Sahibzade</span>, were martyred in battle at Chamkaur Sahib, fighting with valor against overwhelming odds, at the young ages of 14 and 18 years old.</p>

    <h2>Char Sahibzade</h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">Char Sahibzade</span>, meaning "Four Sons," refers to the four sons of Guru Gobind Singh, all of whom made the ultimate sacrifice for the faith while still very young. These sons are remembered and revered by Sikhs, and their martyrdom is an essential part of Sikh history.</p>

    <h3>The Martyrdom</h3>
    <p>The <span class="highlight">martyrdom</span> of the Sahibzade is commemorated every year in December, with deep sorrow and respect. The dates <span class="highlight">21st</span> and <span class="highlight">26th December</span> are particularly significant for Sikhs worldwide, as it was on these days in 1705 that <b>Baba Ajit Singh and Baba Jujhar Singh</b>, the older Sahibzade, left for their heavenly abode on the 21st. On the 26th, the younger Sahibzade, <b>Baba Zorawar Singh and Baba Fateh Singh</b>, were tragically martyred by the Mughal forces of Sirhind.</p>

    <div class="quote">
        "The sacrifice of these young warriors is forever etched in the hearts of Sikhs. Their bravery is an inspiration for all generations."
