    <h2>Maghi</h2>
    <p>Maghi is one of the three festivals chosen by Guru Amar Das Ji to be celebrated by Sikhs (the others being Baisakhi and Diwali).</p>
    <p>The Sri Guru Granth Sahib states about the month of Magh:</p>
    <p>People take baths on the first day of Magh; you should take the bath of service of the guru; in holy congregation remember God’s virtues, listen and give discourse of them to all...</p>
    <p>Accordingly, during the month Magh the “Sikh’s cleansing bath should be the dust of saintly congregation (sadh sangat)”...</p>

    <h2>Maghi and the 40 Mukte</h2>
    <p>Sikhs observe Maghi to honour the heroic fight of the Chali Mukte (Forty Liberated Ones) who gave their lives defending Guru Gobind Singh from an imperial army near Khidrane di Dhab in December 1705.</p>

    <h2>Muktsar Mela</h2>
    <p>A large fair is held on Maghi in Muktsar, commemorating the battle site of the Chali Mukte. Pilgrims believe bathing in the pool at Muktsar brings salvation.</p>

    <h2>Parkash Utsav Sri Guru Gobind Singh Ji</h2>
    <p>This festival celebrates the birth of the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh Ji. It is widely celebrated with reverence and joy across the Sikh world.</p>

    <h2>Holla Mohalla</h2>
    <p>Started by Guru Gobind Singh, Holla Mohalla is celebrated in Anandpur Sahib with martial displays by Nihang Singhs, mock battles, kirtan, and spiritual gatherings. It is often called the "Sikh Olympics."</p>

    <h2>Vaisakhi</h2>
    <p>Vaisakhi marks the founding of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Celebrated widely at places like Kesgarh Sahib and Anandpur Sahib with processions, Amrit ceremonies, and communal events.</p>

    <h2>Martyrdom of Guru Arjan</h2>
    <p>Guru Arjan Dev Ji, the fifth Sikh Guru, was martyred on 25 May 1606 in Lahore. This day is remembered with kirtan, katha, and distribution of cold sweet drinks during the hot month of June.</p>

    <h2>First Parkash Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji</h2>
    <p>This day marks the Guru Granth Sahib being declared the eternal Sikh Guru, ending the line of human Gurus.</p>

    <h2>Bandi Chhor Divas (Diwali)</h2>
    <p>This day celebrates the release of Guru Hargobind Ji and 52 Hindu kings from Gwalior Fort. Homes and Gurdwaras are decorated with lights, most notably Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar.</p>

    <h2>Parkash Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji</h2>
    <p>Guru Nanak Dev Ji was born in Nankana Sahib, now in Pakistan. Celebrations include Akhand Paath, processions led by Panj Pyaare, and lighting candles and fireworks.</p>

    <h2>Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadur</h2>
    <p>Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was martyred on 11 November 1675 for defending religious freedom. He refused to convert to Islam under Mughal rule and was beheaded at Chandni Chowk in Delhi.</p>

    <h2>Other Sikh Festivals</h2>
